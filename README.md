I developed a machine learning model using a wine dataset to analyze and classify wine samples based on their chemical properties. To ensure balanced class distribution and reduce sample disparity, I applied data normalization and oversampling - undersampling techniques. The model used classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, SVM, and Logistic Regression to categorize the wines into four quality levels, and clustering algorithms, like K-Means to group them into three distinct clusters based on similarity.
The project included data visualization to better understand the dataset and model performance. Key visualizations included:
 - Correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between chemical features
 - Box plots to examine feature distributions across classes
 - Confusion matrices to evaluate classification accuracy
